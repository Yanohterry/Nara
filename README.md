trying to build  a predictive monitoring app for a bag house filter system.  
i'm in  need of help  for the user interface.  code written in python with trained lstms models that predict data such as motor current and differential pressure using several inputs as seen in code.  
also,  in case of annomaly detection,  the backend code estimates the remaining  useful  life of the equipment.  it also stores all data in  an  SQLite3 database and uses the SMTP(simple mail transfer protocol) to alert users of annomaly  in case they're not on  the platform.  
user interface should be able to display in charts, all data of variables used in code, pop up alerts on  the platform in case of annomaly with remaining useful life for a specific equipment in a dashboard form.

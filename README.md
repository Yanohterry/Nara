Features

- Data Preprocessing:
  Clean raw sensor data, handle missing values, and extract features to prepare for modeling.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
  Visualize trends and patterns through various plots and statistical summaries.

- Predictive Modeling: 
  Apply machine learning algorithms to predict equipment failures with high accuracy.

- Model Evaluation: 
  Utilize metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to validate model performance.

- Actionable Insights: 
  Generate maintenance alerts and recommendations based on predictive outcomes.

Installation

1. Clone the Repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nara.git
   cd nara
   ```

2. Install Dependencies:

   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later, then install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

 Usage

1. Data Preparation:

   - Place your raw sensor data and maintenance logs in the `data/raw` folder.
   - Run the data preprocessing script to clean and process the data:

     ```bash
     python src/data_preprocessing.py
     ```

2. Model Training:

   - Train the predictive maintenance model by running:

     ```bash
     python src/model_training.py
     ```

3. Model Evaluation:

   - Evaluate model performance with:

     ```bash
     python src/model_evaluation.py
     ```

4. Explore the Analysis:

   - Open the Jupyter Notebook for detailed exploration:

     ```bash
     jupyter notebook notebooks/predictive_maintenance.ipynb
     ```
